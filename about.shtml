<p>I am Chair and Professor in
the <a href="https://www.siena.edu/departments/computer-science/">Computer
Science Department</a> at <a href="https://www.siena.edu/">Siena
College</a>.</p>

<p>I attended <a href="https://www.union.edu/">Union
College</a> in Schenectady, New York, finishing my B.S. in Math and
Computer Science in 1992, and my M.S. in Computer Science in 1993.  I
worked as the Graduate Assistant for the <A
HREF="https://www.union.edu/computer-science">Department of
Computer Science</a> during the 1992-93 academic year.</p>

<p>I attended <a href="https://www.rpi.edu/">Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute</a> in Troy, New York, where I finished my
Ph.D. in <A HREF="https://compsci.rpi.edu/">Computer Science</a> in
2000, focused on parallel computing.  I worked with
the <a href="https://scorec.rpi.edu/">Scientific Computation Research
Center</a> (SCOREC) under the
late <A HREF="https://dufresneandcavanaugh.com/tribute/details/1088/Dr-Joseph-Flaherty/obituary.html">Dr. Joseph
Flaherty</a> as a Research Assistant (grad student) and later as a
Research Scientist.  I did some part-time software development work
at Power Technologies, Inc, in
Schenectady, New York, and was a part-time lab manager for the PASTA
(Parallel Asynchronous and Synchronous Theory and Applications) Lab
and taught a few courses as an adjunct instructor in Computer Science
at Union.  </p>

<p>In 2000, I joined the faculty
in <a href="https://csci.williams.edu/">Computer Science</a>
at <a href="https://www.williams.edu">Williams College</a> in
Williamstown, Massachusetts.  I spent seven years there, except for
some time while on leave at
the <a href="https://www.sandia.gov/research/facilities/computer-science-research-institute-csri/">Computer
Science Research Institute</a>
at <a href="https://sandia.gov/">Sandia National Laboratories</a>
in Albuquerque, New Mexico.  In 2007-08 and again in 2009-10, I was on
the faculty in
<a href="https://www.mtholyoke.edu/directory/departments-offices-centers/computer-science"</a>Computer
Science</a> at <a href="https://mtholyoke.edu/">Mount Holyoke
College</a> in South Hadley, Massachusetts.  In that year in between,
I worked as a software developer
at <a href="https://clickshare.com/">Clickshare Service
Corporation</a> and did some teaching at RPI and Siena.  I spent the
2010-11 and 2011-12 academic years in a visiting faculty position at
Siena.  From Fall 2012 to Spring 2016, I was a member of the faculty
in Computer Science
at <a href="https://strose.edu/">The College of Saint Rose</a>,
where I earned tenure in 2015.</p>

<p>In Fall 2016, I returned to Siena.  I earned tenure a few years
later, then a promotion to Professor, and into my current role as
department chair.</p>

<p class="heading">Personal</p>

<div class="text">
<p>My family lives in Amsterdam, New York, the same city where I grew up.</p>

<p>I like to travel for fun and for work, much of which is documented
on my <a href="https://www.teresco.org/pics/">travel and photo
page</a> and tracked on
my <a href="https://travelmapping.net/user/?u=terescoj">Travel Mapping
page</a> (where I was the primary developer and current maintainer),
and often
includes <a href="https://www.teresco.org/pics/baseball.html">baseball
games</a>
or <a href="https://www.teresco.org/pics/skiing.txt">skiing</a>.  On
winter weekends, I am a ski instructor, previously
at <a href="https://bousquetmountain.com/">Bousquet</a>, and since
2008 at <a href="https://www.royalmountain.com/">Royal Mountain</a>.
When it's not baseball season, it's college hockey season, and you can
still find me at Union's Messa Rink at Achilles Center (through March
2025 anyway) for most of Union's home hockey games.</p>

<p>I previously served on the School Board
for <a href="https://www.saintmarysinstitute.com/">Saint Mary's
Institute</a> in Amsterdam,
a <a href="https://www.higherpoweredlearning.org/">Diocese of Albany
    Catholic School</a> enrolling students in Early Childhood to Grade 8.</p>
