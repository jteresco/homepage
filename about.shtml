<p>I attended <a href="http://www.union.edu/">Union
College</a> in Schenectady, New York, finishing my B.S. in Math and
Computer Science in 1992, and my M.S. in Computer Science in 1993.  I
worked as the Graduate Assistant for the <A
HREF="http://tardis.union.edu/cs_dept/cs_dept.html">Department of
Computer Science</a> during the 1992-93 academic year.</p>

<p>I attended <a href="http://www.rpi.edu/">Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute</a> in Troy, New York, where I finished my Ph.D. in <A
HREF="http://www.cs.rpi.edu/">Computer Science</a> in 2000.  My <A
HREF="http://www.cs.williams.edu/~terescoj/research/">research interests</a> are in parallel computing.  I
worked with the <a href="http://www.scorec.rpi.edu/">Scientific
Computation Research Center</a> (SCOREC) under <A
HREF="http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~flaherje">Dr. Joseph Flaherty</a> as a
Research Assistant (grad student) and later as a Research Scientist.
I have done part-time software development work at <A
HREF="http://www.pti-us.com">Power Technologies, Inc</a>, in
Schenectady, New York, and was a part-time lab manager for the <A
HREF="http://www.pasta.union.edu">PASTA Lab</a> (Parallel Asynchronous
and Synchronous Theory and Applications Lab) and taught a few courses
as an adjunct instructor in Computer Science at Union.  </p>

<p>In 2000, I joined the faculty
in <a href="http://www.cs.williams.edu/">Computer Science</a>
at <a href="http://www.williams.edu">Williams College</a> in
Williamstown, Massachusetts.  I spent seven years there, except for
some time while on leave at
the <a href="http://www.cs.sandia.gov/CSRI">Computer Science Research
Institute</a> at <a href="http://www.sandia.gov/">Sandia National
Laboratories</a> in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
In 2007-08 and again in 2009-10, I was on the
faculty in <a href="http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/compsc/"</a>Computer
Science</a> at <a href="http://www.mtholyoke.edu/">Mount Holyoke
College</a> in South Hadley, Massachusetts.  In that year in between,
I worked as a software developer
at <a href="http://www.clickshare.com/">Clickshare Service
Corporation</a> and did some teaching at RPI and Siena College.
I spent the 2010-11 and 2011-12 academic years in a visiting faculty position
in <a href="http://www.cs.siena.edu/">Computer Science</a>
at <a href="http://www.siena.edu/">Siena College</a>.</p>

<p>As of Fall 2012, I have joined the faculty in <a href="http://www.strose.edu/academics/schoolofmathandscience/computer_science">Computer Science</a> at <a href="http://www.strose.edu/">The College of Saint Rose</a>.</p>

<p class="heading">Personal</p>

<div class="text">
I live in Amsterdam, New York, with my wife and daughter.<p>

I like to travel for fun and for work, much of which is documented on
my <a href="http://www.teresco.org/pics/">travel and photo page</a>
and often
includes <a href="http://www.teresco.org/pics/baseball.html">baseball
games</a>
or <a href="http://www.teresco.org/pics/skiing.txt">skiing</a>.  I
have also been a very part-time ski instructor
at <a href="http://www.bousquets.com">Bousquet</a>
and <a href="http://www.royalmountain.com/">Royal Mountain</a>.  When
it's not baseball season, it's college hockey season, and you can
still often find me at Union's Achilles Rink.
