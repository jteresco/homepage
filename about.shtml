I attended <A HREF="http://www.union.edu/">Union
College</A> in Schenectady, New York, finishing my B.S. in Math and
Computer Science in 1992, and my M.S. in Computer Science in 1993.  I
worked as the Graduate Assistant for the <A
HREF="http://tardis.union.edu/cs_dept/cs_dept.html">Department of
Computer Science</A> during the 1992-93 academic year.<P>

I attended <A HREF="http://www.rpi.edu/">Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute</A> in Troy, New York, where I finished my Ph.D. in <A
HREF="http://www.cs.rpi.edu/">Computer Science</A> in 2000.  My <A
HREF="http://www.cs.williams.edu/~terescoj/research/">research interests</A> are in parallel computing.  I
worked with the <A HREF="http://www.scorec.rpi.edu/">Scientific
Computation Research Center</A> (SCOREC) under <A
HREF="http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~flaherje">Dr. Joseph Flaherty</A> as a
Research Assistant (grad student) and later as a Research Scientist.
I have done part-time software development work at <A
HREF="http://www.pti-us.com">Power Technologies, Inc</A>, in
Schenectady, New York, and was a part-time lab manager for the <A
HREF="http://www.pasta.union.edu">PASTA Lab</A> (Parallel Asynchronous
and Synchronous Theory and Applications Lab) and taught a few courses
as an adjunct instructor in Computer Science at Union.  <P>

In 2000, I joined the faculty
in <A HREF="http://www.cs.williams.edu/">Computer Science</A>
at <A HREF="http://www.williams.edu">Williams College</A> in
Williamstown, Massachusetts.  I spent seven years there, except for
some time while on leave at
the <A HREF="http://www.cs.sandia.gov/CSRI">Computer Science Research
Institute</A> at <A HREF="http://www.sandia.gov/">Sandia National
Laboratories</A> in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
In 2007-08 and again in 2009-10, I was on the
faculty in <A HREF="http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/compsc/"</A>Computer
Science</A> at <A HREF="http://www.mtholyoke.edu/">Mount Holyoke
College</A> in South Hadley, Massachusetts.  In that year in between,
I worked as a software developer
at <A HREF="http://www.clickshare.com/">Clickshare Service
Corporation</A> and did some teaching at RPI and Siena College.
For 2010-11, I am on the faculty
in <A HREF="http://www.cs.siena.edu/">Computer Science</A>
at <A HREF="http://www.siena.edu/">Siena College</A>.<P>

<p class="heading">Personal</p>

<div class="text">
I live in Amsterdam, New York, with my wife and daughter.<p>

I like to travel for fun and for work, much of which is documented on
my <A HREF="http://www.teresco.org/pics/">travel and photo page</A>
and often
includes <A HREF="http://www.teresco.org/pics/baseball.html">baseball
games</A>
or <A HREF="http://www.teresco.org/pics/skiing.txt">skiing</A>.  I
have also been a very part-time ski instructor
at <a href="http://www.bousquets.com">Bousquet</a>
and <a href="http://www.royalmountain.com/">Royal Mountain</a>.  When
it's not baseball season, it's college hockey season, and you can
still often find me at Union's Achilles Rink.
