<H3>Student Research Projects</H3>

I have a number of potential student projects waiting for someone to
tackle them.  Contact me if you are interested in a research project
as an independent study, summer project, or an honors thesis.  If you
have any interest in graduate school, getting involved in research is
the best way to get your application noticed by the top programs.<P>
