Ph.D. Dissertation: A Hierarchical Partition Model for Parallel
Adaptive Finite Element Computation, 2000, Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute. Advisor: Joseph E. Flaherty. <A
HREF="http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~terescoj/research/thesis">[Details]</A>

<p>
My Ph.D. work was done in the <A HREF="http://www.cs.rpi.edu">Department
of Computer Science</A> at <A HREF="http://www.rpi.edu">Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute</A>, working with <A
HREF="http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~flaherje">Dr. Joseph Flaherty</A>, whose
group developed software to solve systems of partial
differential equations on parallel machines using adaptive finite
element and related methods.  I was involved in several projects,
including a generic 1-D PDE solver, looking into partition quality
metrics for mesh partitions, and helping to maintain and enhance
software for partitioning and dynamic load balancing of
three-dimensional meshes in a parallel adaptive environment.  One of
our favorite test problems involved <A
HREF="rpi/pmb">simulating the flow in the
perforated muzzle brake of a cannon</A>.  My thesis work included the
design and implementation of the Rensselaer Partition Model, which
includes the parallel mesh infrastructure used by several projects at
RPI's <A HREF="http://www.scorec.rpi.edu">Scientific Computation
Research Center</A>.

<p class="heading">Sandia Collaboration</p>

<div class="text">

I had a multi-year collaboration
with <A HREF="http://www.sandia.gov/">Sandia National Laboratories</A>
in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and spent most of my leave during the
2003-04 academic year as
a <A HREF="http://www.cs.sandia.gov/CSRI/">Computer Science Research
Institute</A> visitor.

I managed the Bullpen Cluster at Williams College for several years.
The cluster was built with Sun hardware.  Some of the Bullpen nodes
were later integrated into the Dhanni Cluster at Williams, and smaller
teaching clusters I constructed at Mount Holyoke and at Siena.
