Software tools for the solution of partial differential equations
using parallel adaptive finite element methods have been developed.
We describe the design and implementation of the parallel mesh
structures within an adaptive framework.  The most fundamental concept
is that of a hierarchical partition model used to distribute finite
element meshes and associated data on a parallel computer.  The
hierarchical model represents heterogeneous processor and network
speeds, and may be used to represent processes in any parallel
computing environment, including an SMP, a distributed-memory
computer, a network of workstations, or some combination of these.
Using this model to segment the computation into chunks which can fit
into cache memory provides a potential efficiency gain from an
increased cache hit rate, even in a single processor environment.  The
information about different processor speeds, memory sizes, and the
corresponding interconnection network can be useful in a dynamic load
balancing algorithm which seeks to achieve a good balance with minimal
interprocessor communication penalties when a slow interconnection
network is involved.
