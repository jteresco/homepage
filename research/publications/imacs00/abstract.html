Reusable software tools for the solution of partial differential
equations using parallel adaptive finite element methods have been
developed.  We describe the design and implementation of the
object-oriented parallel mesh structures within the Rensselaer
Partition Model (RPM).  This hierarchical model is used to distribute
finite element meshes and associated data on a parallel computer.  It
represents heterogeneous processor and network speeds, and may be used
to represent processes in any parallel computing environment,
including an SMP, a distributed-memory computer, a network of
workstations, or some combination of these.  The information about
different processor speeds, memory sizes, and the corresponding
interconnection network can be useful in a dynamic load balancing
algorithm which seeks to achieve a good balance with minimal
interprocessor communication penalties when a slow interconnection
network is involved.  An example of a partitioning scheme which takes
advantage of this information is given.
