We examine the quality of partitions produced by an iterative load
balancer in parallel adaptive finite element calculations.  We present
several metrics which we use to evaluate the quality of a mesh
partitioning, and report statistics generated from our analysis of
adaptively refined meshes produced during the solution of
computational fluid dynamics problems.  Timings from the finite
element solution phase for runs involving these meshes on 16 and 32
processors of an IBM SP2 are also presented.
