Computational grids are characterized by their dynamic, non-dedicated,
and heterogeneous nature. Novel application-level and middleware-level
techniques are needed to allow applications to reconfigure themselves
and adapt automatically to their underlying execution environments to
be able to benefit from computational grids' resources. In this paper,
we introduce a new software framework that enhances the Message
Passing Interface (MPI) performance through process checkpointing,
migration, and an adaptive middleware for load balancing. Fields as
diverse as fluid dynamics, material science, biomechanics, and ecology
make use of parallel adaptive computation where target architectures
have traditionally been supercomputers and tightly coupled clusters.
This framework is a first step in allowing these computations to use
computational grids efficiently. Preliminary results demonstrate that
application reconfiguration through middleware-triggered process
migration achieved performance improvement in the range of 33% to 79%.
