Finding relevant information among the vast amounts of data generated
continuously by modern micro-blogging platforms has opened new
challenges in information retrieval. Recent studies on time-based
retrieval have shown that identifying the relevant time periods to be
incorporated into the retrieval process is promising; by relevant time
period we mean the peak time of a query that satisfies the temporal
needs of the user's query. Or in other words, a time period at which
the potential to find accurate matches for the query in a set of
retrieved documents is relatively high when compared with other time
periods. We refer to this as temporal relevance. In this paper, using
data collected from Twitter, we propose a new temporal relevance
estimation technique based on tracking documents published by the
popular users, who have high indegree (i.e., number of followers). In
this study we concentrate on queries that are short (one word) and
popular, i.e., constantly consumed by micro-bloggers. We choose the
simple frequency-based technique to estimate the relevant time period
as a baseline against which we evaluate our technique. The results of
our technique either match or suggest a better time period as the most
relevant one, when compared with the baseline. In fact, for the type
of queries in our study, narrowing our focus to the documents
published by popular users produces a query-to-documents matching
pattern that uncovers some information about temporal relevance that
might otherwise be hidden. Also, our matching pattern reflects the
nature of the real-world news events that are related to the user's
query more so than the baseline, thus revealing the important time
frames more clearly.
