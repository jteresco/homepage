This paper describes predictive load balancing schemes designed for
use with parallel adaptive finite element methods.  We provide an
overview of data structures suitable for distributed storage of finite
element mesh data as well as software designed for mesh adaptation and
load balancing.  During the course of a parallel computation,
processor load imbalances are introduced at adaptive enrichment steps.
The predictive load balancing methods described here use <I>a
priori</I> estimates of work load for adaptive refinement and
subsequent computation to improve enrichment efficiency and reduce
total balancing time.  An analysis code developed with these
components for solving compressible flow problems is used to obtain
predictive load balancing results on an IBM SP2 computer. Our test
problem involves the transient solution of the three-dimensional Euler
equations of compressible flow inside a perforated shock tube.  We
also present a message passing library extension in development which
allows for automated packing of messages to improve communication
efficiency.
