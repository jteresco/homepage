<P>
Undergraduate computer science programs at many small colleges often
include only one course focused on hardware. Many important concepts
are covered in such a course, including the basics of computer
architecture. By the end of such a course, students should have a good
understanding of how a binary machine instruction is executed in
hardware. Unfortunately, even a simplified diagram of a datapath is
often difficult for students to master. We present two approaches that
use lab exercises to help to address this problem. In one, students
build a working model of the datapath out of ordinary materials; in
the other, a software simulator is designed and implemented. These
approaches are described and their merits discussed.
