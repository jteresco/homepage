An adaptive technique for a partial differential system automatically
adjusts a computational mesh or varies the order of a numerical
procedure to obtain a solution satisfying prescribed accuracy criteria
in an optimal fashion.  We describe data structures for distributed
storage of finite element mesh data as well as software for mesh
adaptation, load balancing, and solving compressible flow problems.
Processor load imbalances are introduced at adaptive enrichment steps
during the course of a parallel computation.  To correct this, we have
developed three dynamic load balancing procedures based, respectively,
on load imbalance trees, moment of inertia, and octree traversal.
Computational results on an IBM SP2 computer are presented for steady
and transient solutions of the three-dimensional Euler equations of
compressible flow.
