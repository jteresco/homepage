Conservation laws are solved by a local Galerkin finite element
procedure with adaptive space-time mesh refinement and explicit time
integration.  A distributed octree structure representing a spatial
decomposition of the domain is used for mesh generation, and later may
be used to correct for processor load imbalances introduced at
adaptive enrichment steps.  A Courant stability condition is used to
select smaller time steps on smaller elements of the mesh, thereby
greatly increasing efficiency relative to methods having a single
global time step.  To accommodate the variable time steps, octree
partitioning is extended to use weights derived from element size.
Computational results are presented for the three-dimensional Euler
equations of compressible flow solved on an IBM SP2 computer.  The
problem examined is the flow inside a perforated shock tube.
