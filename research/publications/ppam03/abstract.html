Over the last two decades, efficient message passing libraries have
been developed for parallel scientific computation.  Concurrently,
programming languages have been created supporting dynamically
reconfigurable distributed systems over the heterogeneous Internet.
In this paper, we introduce SALSA-MPI, an actor programming language
approach to scientific computing that extends MPI with a checkpointing
and migration API and a runtime system that manages both periodic
checkpoints and process or appli cation migration.  The goal is to
enable dynamic network reconfiguration and load balancing without
sacrificing application performance or requiring extensive code
modifications.  As driving technology for this effort of unifying
parallel and distributed computing, we plan to use adaptive solvers of
partial differential equations.  Fields as diverse as fluid dynamics,
material science, biomechanics, and ecology make use of parallel
adaptive computation, but target architectures have traditionally been
supercomputers and tightly-coupled clusters.  SALSA-MPI is intended to
allow these computations to make efficient use of more distributed and
dynamic computing resources.
