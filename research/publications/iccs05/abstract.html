Smaller institutions can now maintain local cluster computing
environments to support research and teaching in high-performance
scientific computation.  Researchers can develop, test, and run
software on the local cluster and move later to larger clusters
and supercomputers at an appropriate time.  This presents challenges
in the development of software that can be run efficiently on a range
of computing environments from the (often heterogeneous) local
clusters to the larger clusters and supercomputers.  Meanwhile, the
clusters are also valuable teaching resources.  We describe the use of
a heterogeneous cluster at Williams College and its role in the
development of software to support scientific computation in such
environments, including two summer research projects completed by
Williams undergraduates.
