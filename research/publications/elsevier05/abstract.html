Computational grids are appealing platforms for the execution of large
scale applications among the scientific and engineering
communities. However, designing new applications and deploying
existing ones with the capability of exploiting this potential still
remains a challenge. Computational grids are characterized by their
dynamic, non-dedicated, and heterogeneous nature. Novel
application-level and middleware-level techniques are needed to allow
applications to reconfigure themselves and adapt automatically to
their underlying execution environments. In this paper, we introduce a
new software framework that enhances the performance of Message
Passing Interface (MPI) applications through an adaptive middleware
for load balancing that includes process checkpointing and
migration. Fields as diverse as fluid dynamics, materials science,
biomechanics, and ecology make use of parallel adaptive
computation. Target architectures have traditionally been
supercomputers and tightly coupled clusters.  This framework is a
first step in allowing these computations to use computational grids
efficiently.
