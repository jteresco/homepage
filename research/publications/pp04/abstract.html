Modern large-scale scientific computation problems must execute in a
parallel computational environment to achieve acceptable performance.
Target parallel environments range from the largest tightly-coupled
supercomputers to heterogeneous clusters of workstations.  Grid
technologies make Internet execution more likely.  Hierarchical and
heterogeneous systems are increasingly common.  Processing and
communication capabilities can be nonuniform, non-dedicated, transient
or unreliable.  Even when targeting homogeneous computing
environments, each environment may differ in the number of processors
per node, the relative costs of computation, communication, and memory
access, and the availability of programming paradigms and software
tools.  Architecture-aware computation requires knowledge of the
computing environment and software performance characteristics, and
tools to make use of this knowledge.  These challenges may be
addressed by compilers, low-level tools, dynamic load balancing or
solution procedures, middleware layers, high-level software
development techniques, and choice of programming languages and
paradigms.  Computation and communication may be reordered.  Data or
computation may be replicated or a load imbalance may be tolerated to
avoid costly communication.  This paper samples a variety of
approaches to architecture-aware parallel computation.

<BR>Note: this volume serves as a proceedings for the Eleventh SIAM
Conference on Parallel Processing for Scientific Computing, held in
San Francisco in February 2004.  Our chapter includes contributions
from each spaker at a minisymposium on "Architecture-Aware Scientific
Computation".<P>
