We develop software tools for the solution of conservation laws using parallel
adaptive discontinuous Galerkin methods.  In particular, the Rensselaer
Partition Model (RPM) provides parallel mesh structures within an adaptive
framework to solve the Euler equations of compressible flow
by a discontinuous Galerkin method (LOCO).  Results are presented for a
Rayleigh-Taylor flow instability for computations performed on 128 processors
of an IBM SP computer.  In addition to managing the distributed data and
maintaining a load balance, RPM provides information about the parallel
environment that can be used to tailor partitions to a specific computational
environment.
