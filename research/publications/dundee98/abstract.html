We describe predictive load balancing schemes for use with parallel
adaptive finite element methods.  We provide an overview of an
infrastructure suitable for distributed storage of finite element mesh
data as well as software designed for mesh adaptation and load
balancing.  The predictive load balancing methods improve enrichment
efficiency and reduce total balancing time by using <I>a priori</I>
estimates of work needed for adaptive refinement and subsequent
computation.  Analysis codes developed with these components for
solving compressible flow problems are used to obtain predictive load
balancing results on an IBM SP2 computer.  Our three-dimensional test
problems involve compressible steady flow about a rotor blade and
transient flow in a perforated shock tube.
