Data partitioning and load balancing are
important components of parallel computations.  Many different partitioning
strategies have been developed, with great effectiveness in
parallel applications.  But the load-balancing problem is not yet
solved completely; new applications and architectures
require new partitioning features.  Existing algorithms must
be enhanced to support more complex applications.  New models are needed
for non-square, non-symmetric, and highly connected systems arising from
applications in biology, circuits, and materials simulations.  Increased
use of heterogeneous computing architectures requires partitioners
that account for non-uniform computing, network, and memory resources.
And, for greatest impact, these new capabilities must be delivered
in toolkits that are robust, easy-to-use, and applicable to a wide
range of applications.  In this paper, we discuss our approaches to
addressing these issues within the Zoltan Parallel Data Services toolkit.
