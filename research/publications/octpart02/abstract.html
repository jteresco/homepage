The Zoltan dynamic load balancing library provides applications with a
reusable object oriented interface to several load balancing
techniques, including coordinate bisection, octree/space filling curve
methods, and multilevel graph partitioners.  We describe enhancements
to Zoltan's octree load balancing procedure and its distributed
structures that improve performance of the space filling curve (SFC)
traversals by exploiting similarities between the octree and SFC
construction.  The SFC implementation includes efficient Morton, Gray
code, and Hilbert tree traversals.  We present the results of a number
of scalability and partition quality studies utilizing the new octree
structures and orderings.
