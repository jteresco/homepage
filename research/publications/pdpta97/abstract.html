This paper describes two predictive load balancing schemes designed
for use with parallel adaptive finite element methods.  We also
provide an overview of data structures suitable for distributed
storage of finite element mesh data as well as software designed for
mesh adaptation and load balancing.  During the course of a parallel
computation, processor load imbalances are introduced at adaptive
enrichment steps.  The predictive load balancing methods introduced
here use <i>a priori</i> estimates of work load for adaptive refinement
and subsequent computation to improve enrichment efficiency and reduce
total balancing time.  These components have been used to build a
system for solving compressible flow problems. Computational results
on an IBM SP2 computer are presented for transient solutions of the
three-dimensional Euler equations of compressible flow.
