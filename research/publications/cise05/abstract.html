The popularity of clusters has opened a new platform for software
originally designed for tightly-coupled supercomputers.  This includes
a large base of portable software, such as solvers for systems of
partial differential equations using finite element and related
methods.  However, design decisions and optimizations are based on the
platform for which the software is first developed.  Moving from a
tightly-coupled supercomputer to a cluster, or even from one cluster
to another may reduce efficiency.  We describe experiences using the
"Bullpen Cluster" at Williams College to run parallel adaptive finite
element software.  The cluster added complications including
nonuniform processor speeds, a mixture of 1-, 2-, and 4-processor
nodes, and a slower network relative to processing speed than previous
platforms.  We describe two application-independent tools that we have
developed to support computing on heterogeneous and hierarchical
clusters: the Dynamic Resource Utilization Model (DRUM), and a
Hierarchical Partitioning and Dynamic Load Balancing system.
