Dynamic load balancing is an essential tool for parallel adaptive
computation.  It has been an important research topic for more than a
decade.  The <I>Zoltan</I> library provides applications with a
reusable, object-oriented interface to several load balancing
algorithms, including coordinate bisection, octree/space filling curve
methods, and multilevel graph partitioners.  It allows run-time
selection among balancing techniques, facilitating comparisons.  It
also provides a framework in which to modify existing algorithms or to
implement new algorithms.  We compare the performance of several
available methods as mesh partitioners and as dynamic load balancers
for an adaptive computation.  Partition quality metrics and running
times of the balancers and the solution process are measured for
several methods.  We also examine the effect of octant granularity for
the Zoltan octree partitioning algorithm, and describe a modification
of the recursive coordinate bisection algorithm that bisects along
only one coordinate axis, to achieve a "slice" partitioning,
designed to minimize interprocessor adjacency.
