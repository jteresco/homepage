Conservation laws are solved by a local Galerkin finite element
procedure with adaptive space-time mesh refinement and explicit time
integration.  The Courant stability condition is used to select
smaller time steps on smaller elements of the mesh, thereby greatly
increasing efficiency relative to methods having a single global time step.
Processor load imbalances, introduced at adaptive enrichment steps,
are corrected by using traversals of an octree representing a spatial
decomposition of the domain.  To accommodate the variable time steps,
octree partitioning is extended to use weights derived from element
size.  Partition boundary smoothing reduces the communications volume
of partitioning procedures for a modest cost.  Computational results
comparing parallel octree and inertial partitioning procedures are
presented for the three-dimensional Euler equations of compressible
flow solved on an IBM SP2 computer.
