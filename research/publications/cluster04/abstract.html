We address the problem of partitioning and dynamic load balancing on
clusters with heterogeneous hardware resources.  We propose DRUM, a
model that encapsulates hardware resources and their interconnection
topology.  DRUM provides monitoring facilities for dynamic evaluation
of communication, memory, and processing capabilities.  Heterogeneity
is quantified by merging the information from the monitors to produce
a scalar number called "power."  This power allows DRUM to be used
easily by existing load-balancing procedures such as those in the
Zoltan Toolkit while placing minimal burden on application
programmers.  We demonstrate the use of DRUM to guide load balancing
in the adaptive solution of a Laplace equation on a heterogeneous
cluster.  We observed a significant reduction in execution time
compared to traditional methods.
