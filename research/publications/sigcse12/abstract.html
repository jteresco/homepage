<P>
It is often a challenge to find interesting and appropriate data sets
to use as examples to demonstrate graph data structures and
algorithms. Goals for the data are often conflicting. The data should
include examples small enough to work through in a class example by
hand, but some large enough to demonstrate important behaviors of a
structure or algorithm. Data should be freely available in a
convenient format and should have some real-world
relevance. Visualization of the data and results computed from it is
helpful.<P>

This paper describes a collection of graph data sets generated from
the Clinched Highway Mapping Project's highway data and some examples
of their use in undergraduate courses on data structures and
algorithms. The source data, the process used to convert the data into
a more useful format, some examples of its use, and a visualization
tool using the Google Maps API, are described.<P>
