Various research applications using the adaptive solution of partial
differential equations and parallel discrete event simulation as
well as the investigation of object oriented programming paradigms are
described. This work utilizes the IBM SP2 at Rensselaer's Scientific
Computation Research Center (SCOREC). The software is designed using
C, C++ and Fortran 90, together with MPI.  Tools described include a
parallel mesh database, load balancers and run-time code
optimizers. Additionally, using plasma codes as an example, we
compare compilers and architecture performance of the SP2 to
competing distributed memory parallel machines.  Applications
studying finite element analysis of problems in biomechanics and
fluid dynamics, the simulation of fusion plasma processes and the
spread of Lyme disease are presented.
