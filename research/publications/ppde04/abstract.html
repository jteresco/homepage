<P>
In parallel simulations, partitioning and load-balancing algorithms
compute the distribution of application data and work to processors.
The effectiveness of this distribution greatly influences the
performance of a parallel simulation.  Decompositions that balance
processor loads while keeping the application's communication costs
low are preferred.  Although a wide variety of partitioning and
load-balancing algorithms have been developed, their effectiveness
depends on the characteristics of the application using them.  In this
chapter, we review several partitioning algorithms, along with their
strengths and weaknesses for various PDE applications.  We also
discuss current efforts toward improving partitioning algorithms for
future applications and architectures.
