Cluster and grid computing has made hierarchical and heterogeneous
computing systems increasingly common as target environments for
large-scale scientific computation.  A cluster may consist of a
network of multiprocessors.  A grid computation may involve
communication across slow interfaces.  Modern supercomputers are often
large clusters with hierarchical network structures.  For maximum
efficiency, software must adapt to the computing environment.  
We focus on partitioning and dynamic load balancing, in particular on
hierarchical procedures implemented within the Zoltan Toolkit, guided
by DRUM, the Dynamic Resource Utilization Model.  Here, different
balancing procedures are used in different parts of the domain.
Preliminary results show benefits to using hierarchical partitionings
on hierarchical systems.
