We address the problem of partitioning and dynamic load balancing on
clusters with heterogeneous hardware resources.  We propose DRUM, a
model that encapsulates hardware resources and their interconnection
topology.  DRUM provides monitoring facilities for dynamic evaluation
of communication, memory, and processing capabilities.  Heterogeneity
is quantified by aggregating the information from the monitors into a
scalar form, easily usable by existing load balancing algorithms.  We
used DRUM to guide load balancing in the solution of a Rayleigh-Taylor
instability problem on a heterogeneous cluster.  A decrease of 22.6%
in execution time out of a theoretical maximum of 24% is observed.
