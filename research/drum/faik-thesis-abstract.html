As clusters and grids become increasingly popular alternatives to
custom-built parallel computers, they expose a growing heterogeneity
in processing and communication capabilities. Performing an effective
load balancing on such environments can be best achieved when the
heterogeneity factor is quantified and appropriately fed into the load
balancing routines.  In this work, we discuss an approach based on
constructing a tree model that encapsulates the topology and the
capabilities of the cluster. The different components of the execution
environment are dynamically monitored and their processing and
communication capabilities are collected and aggregated in a simple
form easily usable when load balancing is invoked.  We used the model,
called DRUM, to guide load balancing in the adaptive solution of three
numerical problems on various cluster configurations. The results
showed a clear benefit from using DRUM, in clusters with computational
or network heterogeneity as well as in non-dedicated clusters.  The
results also showed that DRUM generates a very low overhead.
