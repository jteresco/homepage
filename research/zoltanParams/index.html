<H3>Overview</H3>

Sandia National Laboratories' <A
HREF="http://www.cs.sandia.gov/Zoltan/">Zoltan Toolkit</A>
provides partitioning, load balancing, and other services to parallel
applications.  Zoltan's behavior is, in part, defined by function
calls that set a variety of parameters.  For example, the call<P>

<CENTER><TT>
ierr = Zoltan_Set_Param(zz, "OCT_MAXOBJECTS", "40");
</TT></CENTER><P>

will set the parameter <TT>OCT_MAXOBJECTS</TT> to <TT>40</TT> in the
<TT>Zoltan_Struct *zz</TT>.<P>

The <I>zoltanParams</I> utility allows applications to specify these
parameters in a text file, allowing changes to Zoltan parameters
without need to edit source code, recomipile, and relink the
applications.  A typical situation where this is useful is when trying
different partitioning algorithms and parameters to see which works
best for a particular application on a particular computer.  When
using Zoltan's hierarchical balancing procedures (to be included in a
future Zoltan release) and when interfacing with the <A
HREF="http://www.cs.williams.edu/drum/">Dynamic Resource Utilization
Model (DRUM)</A> to do resource-aware partitioning in heterogeneous
and hierarchical parallel computing environments, the number of
parameters that may be set makes a tool such as <I>zoltanParams</I>
especially useful.<P>

The format of a <I>zoltanParams</I> input file is simple.  It contains
any number of lines of the format:<P>

<PRE>
  ZOLTAN_PARAM PARAM_VALUE
</PRE>

which is translated into a call to <TT>Zoltan_Set_Param</TT>, setting
the given parameter to the given value.<P>

When used in conjunction with hierarchical balancing (Zoltan method
<TT>"HIER"</TT>), the file format is slightly more complicated.  If
the parameter is <TT>"LB_METHOD"</TT> and its value is set to
<TT>"HIER"</TT>, the next part of the file is interpreted as
hierarchical balancing parameters:<P>

<PRE>
  num_levels
  level 0 partitions for each proc
  level 0 parameters
  end with LEVEL END
  level 1 partitions for each proc
  level 1 parameters
  end with LEVEL END
  ...

  End file with EOF
</PRE>

<H3>Usage</H3>

To make use of the <I>zoltanParams</I> library, it must be compiled,
either as a standalone library or by adding the source files to the
application's build process.  The one C source file
<TT>zoltanParams_read_file.c</TT> requires MPI and Zoltan.<P>

To use <I>zoltanParams</I>, an application should replace part of its
Zoltan initialization sequence with a <I>zoltanParams</I> call.  A
typical Zoltan initialization sequence, such as:<P>

<PRE>
  /* create zoltan lb object */
  lb = Zoltan_Create(MPI_COMM_WORLD);

  /* register callbacks (not shown) */

  /* set zoltan parameters */
  Zoltan_Set_Param(lb, "NUM_GID_ENTRIES", "2");
  Zoltan_Set_Param(lb, "NUM_LID_ENTRIES", "0");
  Zoltan_Set_Param(lb, "OBJ_WEIGHT_DIM", "1");
  Zoltan_Set_Param(lb, "EDGE_WEIGHT_DIM", "0");
  Zoltan_Set_Param(lb, "RETURN_LISTS", "EXPORT");
  Zoltan_Set_Param(lb, "OCT_METHOD", "2");
  Zoltan_Set_Param(lb, "OCT_MAXOBJECTS", "40");
  Zoltan_Set_Param(lb, "OCT_MINOBJECTS", "10");
  Zoltan_Set_Param(lb, "LB_METHOD", "OCTPART");
</PRE>

would be replaced by this code:

<PRE>
  /* create zoltan lb object */
  lb = Zoltan_Create(MPI_COMM_WORLD);

  /* register callbacks (not shown) */

  zoltanParams_read_file(lb, "zoltan.params", MPI_COMM_WORLD);
</PRE>

where the file <TT>"zoltan.params"</TT> in the working directory
contains:

<PRE>
NUM_GID_ENTRIES 2
NUM_LID_ENTRIES 0
OBJ_WEIGHT_DIM 1
EDGE_WEIGHT_DIM 0
RETURN_LISTS EXPORT
OCT_METHOD 2
OCT_MAXOBJECTS 40
OCT_MINOBJECTS 10
LB_METHOD OCTPART
</PRE>

Note: <I>zoltanParams</I> uses static storage to save hierarchical
balancing parameters, and such parameters are stored permanently by
<TT>zoltanParams_read_file</TT> and remain available for use by
hierarchical balancing until overridden by a subsequent call to
<TT>zoltanParams_read_file</TT>.

<H3>Availability</H3>

<I>zoltanParams</I> is freely available.  To get a copy, please contact
the developer at <I>terescoj AT cs.williams.edu</I> (replace AT
with @).  It is written in standard C, and should compile anywhere
that has a decent C compiler.
