o Adaptive Solution Techniques (intro stolen from Dr. Flaherty)
  - Jim's 1D code (text from Jim; link to Jim's Research page)
  - Mohammed's 2D code (from papers and/or Mohammed; see if Mohammed
has old pictures)
o Linear Algebra (Wes)
  - preconditioners
o Error Estimation (? ; Dr. Flaherty always talks about Karen Devine's
error estimator, but I don't know anything about it; we may drop this)
o Integration (?) (Toshi ; they haven't published a paper about this;
was the technique developed by someone else?; drop it?)
o Automatic Solution Framework for PDEs (can Wes write briefly about
this; steal something from Dr. Flaherty)
o Applications (see if we can get pictures from Slimane; text from papers?)
  - crystal growth
  - composite media
  - biomechanics (PSE link)

(other points to keep in mind:
    need to mention/define SCOREC in page at some point
    add Dr. Shephard to the top of page ? probably
    should Dr. Luk's research be on this page?
)
