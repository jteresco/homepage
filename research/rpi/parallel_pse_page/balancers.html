Initial mesh partitioning uses either Inertial Recursive Bisection
(IRB), which repeatedly bisects the mesh in a direction orthogonal to
the principal axis of inertia of the domain, or Octree Partitioning
(OCT), which uses the octree structure underlying the mesh to achieve
a balanced load.  Rebalancing must be parallel since the mesh is
distributed.  Available dynamic load balancing procedures include
Iterative Tree Balancing (ITB), which migrates entities between
partitions by optimizing neighborhood load-request trees, Parallel
Sort Inertial Recursive Bisection (PSIRB), which performs IRB with a
parallel sort of the data, and OCT.  A predictive procedure in which error indicators are used during
load balancing to help reduce imbalance during both the refinement
stage of enrichment and the subsequent solution phase has also been
developed.

<b> Nonpredictive vs. Predictive Procedures: </b> (left) Existing nonpredictive enrichment procedure (While a few iterations of ITB are done after each stage, a full load balancing is only performed after enrichment is complete). (right) Predictive enrichment procedure which can eliminate the need for load balancing after enrichment while moving a coarser structure.
