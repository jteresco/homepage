<P>
The partition model is one level of a hierarchical classification.  A
mesh entity is classified on a partition model entity.  Partition
model entities (represented by the colors in (b)) are classified on
<b>process model</B> entities (c), allowing multiple partitions to be
assigned to a single process or thread of execution.  And the process
model entities are classified on a <b>machine model</B> (d), allowing
multiple processes to be assigned to a single machine ``entity'' (a
physical machine or processor), which is useful with symmetric
multi-processing (SMP), different network speeds, or heterogeneous
processors.
<P>

The next generation of parallel architecture is likely to consist of
SMP nodes connected by a fast (or potentially not so fast) network.  A
possibility is a machine similar to an IBM SP2, but with multiple
processing units on each node.  This sort of architecture can be
accounted for in the model hierarchy by assigning multiple processes
to a single machine.  Boundaries between submeshes which are
classified on different partition models but which are assigned to the
same processor (or at least the same address space) will not need
duplicated entities and can access information about the neighboring
processor's mesh without communication.  This is much less costly than
a true interprocessor message, which must traverse some sort of
network.  This type of information should be available to a load
balancer, and this model hierarchy will provide for that.
