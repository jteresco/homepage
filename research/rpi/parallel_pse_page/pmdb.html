The SCOREC Mesh Database (MDB) provides a hierarchical representation
of a finite element mesh along with operators to query and update the
mesh data structure.  The Parallel Mesh Database (PMDB), built on top
of MDB, provides operators to create and manipulate distributed
meshes.  PMDB holds MDB meshes on each processor that are subsets of
the complete one.

Doubly linked structures of partition boundary entities:
(a) global view and (b) partition boundary view.  E and V denote 
lists of all partition boundary edges and vertices, respectively.
Symbols with subscripts indicate lists of entities adjacent to a particular
processor.   The circled number two in (b) corresponds to the small number
two in (a).  The ordered pairs are processor-address pairs.

Two-dimensional example of a distributed mesh.  Arrows
represent interprocessor pointers between boundary entities.  Heavy
edges and vertices indicate the unique owner of each shared boundary
entity.

Interprocessor boundary entity lists and interprocessor links provide
fast query and update operations on mesh structures.  PMDB provides
arbitrary <A HREF="migration.html"> multiple mesh migration </A> and
routines to analyze partition quality.  PMDB data structures and
operators are used in all stages of an adaptive computation.
MPI is used for interprocessor communication.
