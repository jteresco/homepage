<B>Parallel tree construction:</B> A simple tree having root A appears
on the left above.  Its data structure including bounding box
information is stored in &Acirc;.  On the right, the tree has been
distributed across three processors.  The dotted circles indicate
remote references. Only the remote location is stored in these cases.
All data associated with a node is stored on its assigned processor.
Each processor has a local root list denoted by <I>LR</I>, and each
local root has a data structure storing its bounding box and tree
level information.
