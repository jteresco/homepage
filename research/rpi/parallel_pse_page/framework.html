<H1>SCOREC Parallel Adaptive Framework</H1>
</center>


The SCOREC Parallel Adaptive Framework integrates all of these tools
into a single environment while providing higher levels of abstraction
to simplify the creation of software to solve new problems. Each
component of the system is designed with a common and consistent
interface which allow the author of an anaylsis program to pick
and choose appropriate components and be assured that they will be
able to work together, where appropriate.  This includes components
developed entirely within the framework, such as the mesh structures
and solution database, as well as those implemented as wrapper
interfaces to existing packages, such as the Parasolid or Shapes
geometric modelling packages or an ODE solver such as DASPK.
<P>

The focus here is on the design and implementation of the structures
which will be needed to run programs within the SCOREC analysis
framework on parallel computers.  The same analysis application code
should be able to execute on a single processor with a single thread
of execution as well as on a parallel machine.  A proper design is
essential to allow this to happen.
<P>


Not all components of the analysis framework need to be explicitly
parallel.  Any component which has the potential to access
off-processor data must either be aware of the parallelism explicitly
or have the parallelism abstracted out to lower level structures.  As
the underlying data structure for all framework code, the mesh
structures are the most obvious place where parallelism will need to
be explicit, but there are others. 
<P>


<H4>The Partition Model</H4>

The notion of mesh partitioning is more general than that of PMDB.
There, top-level mesh entities are each assigned to a unique processor
and any entities shared between top-level entities on different
processors are replicated.  The new distributed mesh structures are
being implemented based on a <A HREF=partmodel.html>partition
model</A> , analogous to the geometric model used to classify mesh
entities on the geometry of the problem domain.  All mesh entities
classified on a partition model entity must be assigned to the same
processor.  More than one partition model entity may be assigned to a
single process.  The ability to assign multiple partition model
entities to a processor will allow these classifications to be used in
mesh migration.  Dynamic creation and deletion of processor model
entities is also necessary.
