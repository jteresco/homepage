<H1>Parallel Communications Library</H1>

There is a group of collective communication routines (formerly in
PMDB) that can also be useful to applications, and these are made
available as a message-library independent method of doing some
commonly-used collective communications.<P> <HR>

<H2>Initialization</H2>

<PRE>void com_init()</PRE>

This function initializes internal communication variables for
communications.  This is called by any of the parallel mesh loading
and partitioning operators in PMDB automatically, but if you plan to
use any of the other communication routines before calling a mesh
loading or partitioning routine, you should first call
<tt>com_init()</tt><P>

<HR>

<PRE>void com_deinit()</PRE>

This function cleans up when finished using the communication
routines.<P>

<HR>

<h2>Aborting</h2>

<PRE>void com_abort(char *function, char *message)</PRE>

This function aborts the communications library and the program.  If
the <tt>function</tt> or <tt>message</tt> parameters are non-NULL, an
error message is printed first.<P>

<HR>

<H2>Parallel Communication Parameters</H2>

<PRE>int com_numprocs()</PRE>
<PRE>int COM_NUMPROCS</PRE>

The number of processors, as computed by <tt>com_init()</tt>.  This
value is available through the function <tt>com_numprocs</tt> or in
the global integer value <TT>COM_NUMPROCS</TT>.<P>

<HR>

<PRE>int com_pid()</PRE>
<PRE>int COM_PID</PRE>

The process ID as computed by <tt>com_init()</tt>.  This value is
available through the function <tt>com_pid</tt> or in the global
integer value <TT>COM_PID</TT>.<P>

<HR>

<PRE>int COM_MASTER</PRE>

The process ID of the master process.<P>

<HR>

<h2>Processor Synchronization</h2>

<PRE>void com_all_sync()</PRE>

This function synchronizes all processors.<P>

<HR>

<PRE>void com_sync_io()</PRE>

Call this function to synchronize output.  It doesn't always work,
unforuntately.  stdout printing is often highly asynchronous...<P>

<HR>

<h2>Combine Operators</h2>

In the following functions, there are three arguments.  <tt>in</tt>
provides an input array of <tt>count</tt> values, and the result of
the operation is returned in the array <tt>out</tt>.<P>

<HR>

<PRE>void com_prefix_long(long *in, long *out, int count)</PRE>

This operator does a parallel prefix addition operation for
<tt>long</tt> values.<P>

<HR>

<PRE>void com_prefix_int(int *in, int *out, int count)</PRE>

This operator does a parallel prefix addition operation for
<tt>int</tt> values.<P>

<HR>

<PRE>void com_prefix_float(float *in, float *out, int count)</PRE>

This operator does a parallel prefix addition operation for
<tt>float</tt> values.<P>

<HR>

<PRE>void com_prefix_double(double *in, double *out, int count)</PRE>

This operator does a parallel prefix addition operation for
<tt>double</tt> values.<P>

<HR>

<PRE>void com_add_long(long *in, long *out, int count)</PRE>

This operator does an all-processor-result addition operation for
<tt>long</tt> values.<P>

<HR>

<PRE>void com_max_long(long *in, long *out, int count)</PRE>

This operator does an all-processor-result max operation for
<tt>long</tt> values.<P>

<HR>

<PRE>void com_min_long(long *in, long *out, int count)</PRE>

This operator does an all-processor-result min operation for
<tt>long</tt> values.<P>

<HR>

<PRE>void com_add_int(int *in, int *out, int count)</PRE>

This operator does an all-processor-result addition operation for
<tt>int</tt> values.<P>

<HR>

<PRE>void com_max_int(int *in, int *out, int count)</PRE>

This operator does an all-processor-result max operation for
<tt>int</tt> values.<P>

<HR>

<PRE>void com_add_double(double *in, double *out, int count)</PRE>

This operator does an all-processor-result addition operation for
<tt>double</tt> values.<P>

<HR>

<PRE>void com_max_float(float *in, float *out, int count)</PRE>

This operator does an all-processor-result max operation for
<tt>float</tt> values.<P>

<HR>

<PRE>void com_max_double(double *in, double *out, int count)</PRE>

This operator does an all-processor-result max operation for
<tt>double</tt> values.<P>

<HR>

<PRE>void com_min_double(double *in, double *out, int count)</PRE>

This operator does an all-processor-result min operation for
<tt>double</tt> values.<P>

<HR>

<h2>Broadcast Operators</h2>

<PRE>void com_bcast_int(int *buffer, int root, int count)</PRE>

This operator does a broadcast operation of the buffer of <tt>int</tt>
values from the buffer on processor <tt>root</tt> to the buffer on all
other processors.<P>

<HR>

<PRE>void com_bcast_double(double *buffer, int root, int count)</PRE>

This operator does a broadcast operation of the buffer of <tt>double</tt>
values from the buffer on processor <tt>root</tt> to the buffer on all
other processors.<P>

<HR>

<H2>Timing</H2>

<PRE>double com_wall_time()</PRE>

This returns the number of seconds since a fixed time in the past.
There is no consistency between processors.<P>

<HR>

<h2>Higher-level Communication Routines</h2>

<PRE>void com_comp_recvs(int num_sends, int *dest_pids,
                    int *num_recvs, int **src_pids)</PRE>

This operator computes a list and number of source pids for each
processor, based on the number of sends and the destination pids for
each processor.  <tt>dest_pids</tt> points to a list of
<tt>num_sends</tt> pids which this processor wished to send to.
<tt>num_recvs</tt> is returned as the number of requests that other
processors made to this processor, and <tt>src_pids</tt> is a pointer
to a list of the pids which made requests.  <I>Note: the pointer
returned in <tt>src_pids</tt> is dynamically allocated memory, and
must be released with a call to <tt>free()</tt> after the values are
used.</I> <P>

<HR>

<PRE>void com_request_pid(int req_from_pid, int *num_reqs_by, 
                    int **reqs_by)</PRE>

This operator is called on each processor.  Each processor sends a PID
to request from in <tt>req_from_pid</tt>.  In <tt>reqs_by</tt>, a list
of PIDs which requested from this processor is returned, and the
number of PIDs in the list is returned in <tt>num_reqs_by</tt>.
<I>Note: the pointer returned in <tt>reqs_by</tt> is dynamically
allocated memory, and must be released with a call to <tt>free()</tt>
after the values are used.</I> <P>
