<P>
  This document describes the routines or <i> operators</i> available in the 
<tt> PMDB</tt> runtime library.   
<tt> PMDB</tt> executes a copy of <tt> MDB</tt> in 
SPMD mode on each processor and provides the following categories of 
procedures to manipulate, manage, and provide information about the 
distributed mesh:
<UL><LI> <i> Mesh loading and partitioning routines</i> read in meshes stored 
      in files and distribute them onto the processors. The meshes 
      can either be already partitioned in which case they are read in 
      parallel,  or they can be partitioned after
      they are loaded on processor(s).  
<LI> <i> Geometric model operators</i> initializes up the correspondence between
      the addresses of geometric entities and their geometric model
      identification tags. This needs to done by <tt> PMDB</tt> since
      when the geometric model is loaded on each processor, mesh
      entities point to the addresses of geometric entities as part 
      of their classification. 
<LI> <i> Query routines</i> return information related 
      to the entities which are shared between processors. 
      A rich set of queries about processor adjacency, and links to 
      other shared entities are supported.
<LI> <i> Update routines</i> provide the operators 
      with which the shared entities and their links accross the 
     processors can be manipulated.  If the mesh is not changed by 
     an application, then there is no need to use these routines.
<LI> <i> Gather/scatter maps</i> provide a high level 
    interface to a FEM programs which needs to access the 
    degrees of freedom or <i> nodes</i> on partition boundaries. Boundary 
    node  numbers and their correspondents on adjacent processors
    are returned. These maps minimize the effort to setup 
    communication buffers for exchanging solution values during 
    FEM solver phases.
<LI> <i> Mesh Migration</i> routines enable entities to be redistributed
   in an unrestrictive manner. In addition,
 applications which use 
 routines such as load balancing or just need to migrate 
   entities among processors needs a mechanism whereby user specific data
   should also be migrated together with the entities. For example,
   adaptive finite element programs may store solution or elemental 
   matrices on entities. The stored data may be irregular - e.g. 
   p-adaptive methods may need to store vectors of different length 
   on each entity. <tt> PMDB</tt> provides operators which users  can 
   call to register attached data by its tag and its storage size.  Any 
   entity which is migrated and which has data identified with a 
   registered tag will also have its data migrated and attached 
   automatically after reaching the destination processor. 
<LI> <i> Load balancing</i> may be needed after refinement or coarsening is 
  performed. <tt> PMDB</tt> provides an iterative scheme which 
  balances the number of elements on each processor.
<LI> <i> Visualization</i>: These routines provide IBM data explorer 
  output to aid in visualization of partitioned meshes.
</UL>
<P>
 The following types are used and are described in detail in 
the <tt> SCOREC MDB</tt> manual [<A HREF="#mbeall"></A>].
<UL><LI> <tt> pEntity</tt> a generic entity which can be region, face 
                    edge or vertex.
<LI> <tt> pNode</tt>: a finite element node or degree of freedom which 
                   can be attached to the entities.
<LI> <tt> eType</tt>: represents the type of the entity. It can be any one 
                   of <code>Tvertex</code>, <code>Tedge</code>, <code>Tface</code>, 
                   <code>Tregion</code> or <code>TNode</code>.
</UL>
<P>
 Throughout manual the variable names given below appear extensively as 
parameters to library routines:
<UL><LI> <tt> num_of_procs</tt> : total number of processors used.
<LI> <tt> pid</tt>: processor id.
</UL>
<P>
  Figure <A HREF="ex1.c"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.cs.rpi.edu/icons/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> presents an example code of how 
<tt> PMDB</tt> library can be used to load and partition a mesh 
using orthogonal bisection. The code presents a standard template
of calls to load and distribute a mesh over processors. The call 
to <tt> pmdb_ortho_rb()</tt> can be replaced with any other mesh loading
or partitioning routines described in section <A HREF="node3.html#opmpar"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.cs.rpi.edu/icons/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>. The 
call to <tt> do_something()</tt> can be replaced with code that uses 
the library routines presented in this manual.
