Adaptive finite element methods (FEMs) for partial differential
equations (PDEs) provide greater efficiency, reliability, and
robustness than classical methods by automatically refining or
coarsening portions of the space-time domain (<I>h</I>-refinement),
varying the method order (<I>p-</I>refinement), and/or moving the mesh
to follow evolving phenomena (<I>r-</I>refinement).  As such,
extensive computational effort is confined to regions where solution
resolution is inadequate.  Estimates of discretization errors are used
to control solution accuracy and provide a measure of confidence in
the results.<P>
 
In order to solve large problems in reasonable times, adaptive methods
must execute efficiently on parallel computers.  A good initial
partitioning of the space-time domain is not sufficient to assure high
performance throughout the computation.  Adaptive enrichment causes
load imbalances that necessitate a dynamic redistribution of data.<P>

<H3>SCOREC Tools</H3>

Several tools that facilitate parallel adaptive FEM computation have
been developed at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.  The SCOREC
Mesh Database (MDB) provides a hierarchical representation of a finite
element mesh along with operators to query and update the mesh data
structure.  The SCOREC Finite Octree Automatic Mesh Generator uses a
geometric (CAD) model of the domain to generate an initial mesh.  Mesh
enrichment procedures perform parallel <I>h-</I>refinement using error
indicator information and enrichment thresholds.  The Parallel Mesh
Database (PMDB), built on top of MDB, provides operators to create and
manipulate distributed meshes.  PMDB holds MDB meshes on each
processor that are subsets of the complete one.  Interprocessor
boundary entity lists and interprocessor links provide fast query and
update operations on mesh structures.  PMDB provides arbitrary
multiple mesh migration, and routines to analyze partition quality.
MPI is used for interprocessor communication.<P>

<H3>Partitioning and Rebalancing</H3>

Initial mesh partitioning uses either Inertial Recursive Bisection
(IRB), which repeatedly bisects the mesh in a direction orthogonal to
the principal axis of inertia of the domain, or Octree
Partitioning (OCT), which uses the octree structure underlying the mesh
to achieve a balanced load.  Rebalancing must be parallel since the
mesh is distributed.  Available dynamic load balancing procedures
include Iterative Tree Balancing (ITB), which migrates entities
between partitions by optimizing neighborhood load-request trees,
Parallel Sort Inertial Recursive Bisection (PSIRB), which performs IRB
with a parallel sort of the data, and OCT.<P>

<H3>Sample Results</H3>

As an example, consider the three-dimensional unsteady compressible
(EULER) flow in a cylinder containing a cylindrical ``vent hole.''
This problem simulates a (simplified) perforated muzzle brake for a
cannon.  Using symmetry, the flow need only be solved in one half of
the domain bounded by a plane through the vent.  The <A HREF=pmb2.gif>initial mesh</A>
contained 80,791 tetrahedral elements.  The larger cylinder initially
contains helium gas moving at Mach 1.23 while the vent is quiet.  A
hypothesized diaphragm between the two cylinders is ruptured to begin
the flow.<P>
 
Time steps are either accepted or rejected based on whether or not
elemental error indicators exceed a prescribed tolerance.  Rejected
time steps are repeated subsequent to adaptive h-refinement and
rebalancing.  Coarsening is essential to keep mesh sizes manageable as
areas of interest move through the domain.  Upon h-refinement, the
solution is interpolated to the new mesh and the integration continues
with, possibly, a new time step.  Accepted steps continue with,
possibly, a new global time step.<P>
 
The accompanying picture, obtained using 16 processors of an IBM SP-2,
displays the Mach number with velocity vectors and mesh partitioning
using PSIRB.  Flow features compare favorably with experimental and
numerical results of Nagamatsu, Carofano, et al. (US Army ARDEC,
ARCCB-TR-87016, 1987).  Animations of the <A
HREF=anim.density.gif>solution density</A> and <A
HREF=anim.machnum.gif>solution mach number</A> are available.  There
are also animations of solution mach number with velocity vectors, a
<A HREF=mach-arrows-big.html>large format</A> and <A
HREF=mach-arrows.html>smaller format</A>.<P>

We have demonstrated a capability to perform large-scale parallel
adaptive FEM computation.  We have used these tools to examine the
Euler flow in intersecting cylinders simulating a perforated muzzle
brake.  The tools and techniques referenced here are generic and are
being used to solve problems in many areas including materials
processing, crystal growth, and biomechanics.<P>
