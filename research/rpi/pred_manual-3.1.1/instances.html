<P>

There are three instances of the library compiled with different
flags available:

<P>

<TABLE BORDER>
<TR>
<TD><code>pred</code></TD><TD>is compiled with -g and all optimizations turned off</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD><code>pred-O</code></TD><TD>does not use the -g option and uses -O3 -qstrict</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD><code>pred-time</code></TD><TD>is optimized just as pred-O is and contains code to do
instrumentation; it will create a directory 'PredTimes' in your
current working directory and deposit files with timings of
refinement, predictive, and nonpredictive balancing.  If this library
is used and nonpredictive balancing is to be done during refinement, a
call to
  <tt>refdref_set_rebal_func(pred_nonpred_balance_refdref)</tt>
should be made to handle the timing of the nonpredictive balancing.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

instances of the library:

<TABLE BORDER>
<TR>
<TD><code>pred_oct</code></TD><TD> contains functions to perform predictive Octree
balancing; it is otherwise the same as pred</TD>

balancing; it is otherwise the same as pred-O</TD>
</TR>

<TD><code>pred_oct-time</code></TD><TD>contains functions to perform predictive Octree
balancing; it is otherwise the same as pred-time</TD>
