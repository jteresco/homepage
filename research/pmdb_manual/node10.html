  In order to migrate entities, the user should take three steps:
First, all the  data which are attached to the entities should be 
<i> registered</i> with its four character <tt> MDB</tt> identification tag. This 
registration process is done only once at the beginning of the program. 
During the program run, it is also possible to <i> unregister</i> tags 
which have already been registered.   If an entity which has unregistered
data attached is migrated, 
memory leaks will 
result since there is no way for <tt> PMDB</tt> (which does not have  
access to <tt> MDB</tt> internal data structures) 
to find out whether any data
is attached to an entity.  There may be unintentional attempts by different 
library writers to use identical tags for their own attached data. Such 
actions can have disastrous effects. The return codes from registration
mechanism also provides a means to prevent such scenarios.
<P>
 Having registered attached data, the user needs to prepare arrays which 
contain the entities to be migrated  and their destination processor ids.
 Since preparing these arrays maybe cumbersome, a utility
routine is provided to do this. The user  can call 
<tt> pmdb_insert_mig_entity</tt>() repeatedly with the entity address
and the destination processor for migration to prepare these arrays.
<P>
 Finally, the migration routines themselves can be called to perform 
the movement of entities to destination processors and to do a follow-up
link update procedure.
<P>

<PRE>int pmdb_tag_registerI(
pMeshPB pmeshpb,       /* IN */
eType   etype,         /* IN */
char   *tag,           /* IN */
unsigned char opts)    /* IN */
</PRE>
<P>

This function registers an integer attached data for entities of
<code>etype</code>.  The integer data is of length
<code>sizeof(long)</code> bytes.  Once a tag has been registered, when
entities of <code>etype</code> are migrated, the attached data is also
migrated and attached back when the entity is created at the target
processor.  <P>

It returns 1 if the <code>tag</code> has been successfully registered and 
0 if it has not successfully been registered due to presence of
a duplicate tag.
<P>

The additional options allow the attachment of data with a requirement
that the tag be unique and that the data should not be migrated.  To
obtain the default behavior, <code>PMDB_TAG_DEFAULT</code> should be
passed in for <code>opts</code>.  Other options are
<code>PMDB_TAG_NOMIGRATE</code> to specify attachments that should not
be migrated, but are being registered for the purpose of ensuring
uniqueness, and <code>PMDB_TAG_UNIQUE</code> causes the program to
abort if the same tag has been registered twice.  To specify both,
pass in <code>PMDB_TAG_NOMIGRATE|PMDB_TAG_UNIQUE</code>.
<P>

<PRE>int pmdb_tag_unregisterI(
pMeshPB pmeshpb,         /* IN */
eType   etype,           /* IN */
char   *tag)             /* IN */
</PRE>
<P>
This routine deletes a registered integer data <code>tag</code>.
It returns 1 if the tag has been successfully unregistered (deleted) and 
0 if the <code>tag</code> could not be found for unregistering.
<P>

<HR>
<PRE>int pmdb_tag_registerP(
pMeshPB pmeshpb,       /* IN */
eType   etype,         /* IN */
char   *tag,           /* IN */
int     size,          /* IN */
unsigned char opts)    /* IN */
</PRE>
<P>

This function registers a pointer attached data for entities of
<code>etype</code>.  The data is <i> assumed</i> to be in contiguous
block. It is possible to handle structures containing pointers to
other data by allocating all the data including the structure itself
in <i> one</i> contiguous block.  <P>

If <code>size</code> <b>&gt; 0</b>, then the attached data is assumed
to have <i> fixed</i> length and its length in bytes is given by
<code>size</code>.  If, on the other hand, <code>size</code> <b>&lt;
0</b>, then the attached data has <i> variable</i> length and the <i>
first</i> integer (<code>sizeof(int)</code> bytes) of the attached
data is assumed to contain the size of the attached data in bytes
including the first integer itself.  <P> At its completion, the
routine returns <b>1</b> if the <code>tag</code> has been successfully
registered and 0 otherwise.
<P>

See <tt>pmdb_tag_registerI</tt> for a description of the
<code>opts</code> argument.

This routine deletes a registered pointer attached data tag. It
