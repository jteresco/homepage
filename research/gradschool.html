My Ph.D. work was done in the <A HREF=http://www.cs.rpi.edu>Department
of Computer Science</A> at <A HREF=http://www.rpi.edu>Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute</A>, working with <A
HREF="http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~flaherje">Dr. Joseph Flaherty</A>, whose
group is working on developing software to solve systems of partial
differential equations on parallel machines using adaptive finite
element and related methods.  I was involved in several projects,
including a generic 1-D PDE solver, looking into partition quality
metrics for mesh partitions, and helping to maintain and enhance
software for partitioning and dynamic load balancing of
three-dimensional meshes in a parallel adaptive environment.  One of
our favorite test problems involved <A
HREF="rpi/pmb">simulating the flow in the
perforated muzzle brake of a cannon</A>.  My thesis work included the
design and implementation of the Rensselaer Partition Model, which
includes the parallel mesh infrastructure used by several projects at
RPI's <A HREF="http://www.scorec.rpi.edu">Scientific Computation
Research Center</A>.  More on the dissertation is available <A
HREF="http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~terescoj/research/thesis">here</A>.<P>

Students interested in graduate work (at RPI or elsewhere) should feel
free to discuss this with me or with any other members of the
department.  We strongly recommend getting involved in research if you
are considering grad school, either through summer projects or (better
yet) an honors thesis.<P>

These are unlikely to be of use to anyone, but are included here for
historical interest.
